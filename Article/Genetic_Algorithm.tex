\section{Genetic Algorithm}
	Due to the quantity of parameters to be tuned and the defined granularity, the space search is enormous and it's necessary some space search algorithm. In this study was chosen a evolutionary algorithm.
	
	
	A genetic algorithms are adaptive heuristic search algorithm based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection. Genetics algorithms applications are present at many areas such as control engineering at non-linear system identification, biomedics to develop legs mechanism to proteses and even economy to forecast the behavior of agents.  
	
	Each individual is a string that contain the information necessary to evaluation. Usually, the values that composes the strings are parameters to be tuned. The search space of the optimization of parameters is defined by the representation of the chromosome.
		
	
	A randomly initial population is created, than, accordingly with the fitness function, is associated a score for each individual that represents how good the individual is.	
	
	
	Based on the premise that the better ones is more likely to reproduce a better offspring than others, the parents are chosen by the score of each individual. Thus your genetic material can be spread.
	
	
	To increase a genetic diversity each chromosome has a tiny chance to be mutate, this avoid a fast convergence of the algorithm, trying not to be stuck in a maximum local.
	
	
	For the model with 5 states, it was necessary adjust 22 parameters, each state has a different quantity, including the \emph{transition} function, as follows:

	\emph{Approach Curve} has 4 parameters.

	\emph{Transition Function} has 3 parameters.

	\emph{Straight Line} has 4 parameters.

	\emph{Out of Track} has 7 parameters.

	\emph{Stuck} has 4 parameters.
