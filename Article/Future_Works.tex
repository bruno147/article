\section{Future Works} 	
	\begin{itemize}
		 \item Since at the SCRC the controller is allowed to perform a warm-up before the race it is possible to acquire the track data, not only mapping critical section such as sharp curves and points where the car go out the track to improve the result of the controller at the race itself. Also a warp-up stage would supply the information about environment where the car is, including the type of track,road or dirt, which determine a set of parameters best fitted to which occasion. 
        
		\item One important task to be accomplish is the opponent treatment, routines to reduce collisions, avoid the controller to be surpassed and surpass the opponents is a fundamental issue. Ignoring the opponent would make the driver to face unexpected collisions ending stuck, considering the worst event.
