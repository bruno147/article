\section{Methodology and Experiments} \label{sec:exp}
	Once defined the model and what parameters has to be tuned. In order to find the best configuration of parameters of the controller designed it was use a genetic algorithm.
	
	To find a general controller with good results for any track, the controller is evaluate with relation it's performance in various track, including dirt tracks and road tracks. 
	
	Due to the differences between dirt track and road tracks, it was made a two isolated evolution of controller, the first only on road tracks and the other one only on dirt tracks.
	
	Each individual race alone in a list of tracks, and the sum of the distance raced in the firstly 10000 cycles of time in each track is the fitness of the individual.
	
	In the end of evolution there will be pass more than 600 generations, each generation with 30 individuals.
