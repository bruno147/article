		This work presents two different approaches developed to control a self-driving car in the racing environment
		simulated by TORCS. The problematic revolves around the representation of the complex behaviour that
		describes a pilot during a race, whose proposed solution is a finite-state machine; while one method treats
		the problem with a more partitioned approach, the other tries to generalize the possible situations.
		Furthermore, in order for the final controller to attain competitive status, i.e. parameter fine tuning, the
		incorporation of a genetic algorithm was performed. Evolving the driver using this method initially required
		the definition of a set of parameters, where the optimization lied effectively. Validation occurred through
		exhaustively testing the configurations of the two approaches, comparing them along with artificial
		intelligences provided by the platform and also State of the Art implementations.
