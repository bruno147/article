\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:5}
Self-driving cars are one of the most interesting promises of technology, but the process of developing a software controller is complex and expensive. Advanced car racing simulators present a well defined environment for developing such drivers and comparing Artificial intelligence solutions, and The Open Racing Car Simulator/Simulated Car Racing Championship platforms have been successfully used to this end.

This work presented two version of finite-state machine controllers which clearly break the task into distinct behaviors (states), facilitating testing different configurations and simplifying the search for better configurations. This search was executed by applying a genetic algorithm with default configurations to evolve racing condition parameters in the proposed model.

Experimental results showed that



% FSM is a well-known mathematical model with widespread applications such as controlling air conditioning systems~\cite{BERNARD}, highway surveillance systems~\cite{DOHYUN}, and even simulated car racing~\cite{DIEGO}. Such solutions are implemented as software and configured according to a specified set of parameters, and defining the best possible configuration is usually a huge combinatorial problem for which exhaustive systematic searches become unfeasible.

% Autonomous vehicles have many practical applications, however the development of software controllers for such task is difficult. This work presents a finite state-machine model with evolved parameters as a suitable solution for a self-driving car, and the comparison of two different configurations in The Open Racing Car Simulator. This approach enables a clear division of behaviors in states, providing an easy way to test different configurations and simplifying the search for better controllers by allowing changes in selected states. A 5-state and a 3-state drivers were evolved through genetic algorithm and compared to each other and to AUTOPIA, the current state of the art controller for the Simulated Car Racing Championship. Results showed that the proposed model has potential for racing, even surpassing one of AUTOPIA's marks, and provide insights on developing and configuring.

%	This paper proposed two approaches developed to control a car during a race in a simulated computational environment, the game platform TORCS. The models of both of these controllers were described, explained, enhanced by means of a genetic algorithm, compared and then tested together with a State of the Art controller - AUTOPIA. It was implied before the testing phase that a finite state machine too burdened in the process of transition between states might lose performance, which was corroborated by the experimental results of the comparison of the two models detailed.

% \subsection{Conclusions} \label{subsec:Conclusions}

%	A veil was put over the Five-State FSM from the very beginning of the experimentation phase, which was its great dependency towards the transition function. Early superficial evaluations of the performance of this first model indicated an overcharge concerning this function, which was verified by considerable changes in behaviour derived from adjustments in its parameters. For that reason, a second model with less states - the Three-State FSM - was designed regarding this characteristic and releasing part of the performance burden from the transition function.

%	The finite state machine with less states achieved a superior overall performance in the tests carried out, in relation to the one with more states. The simplifications fashioned in the transition function of the former were inferred to be the reason for this improvement, along with its intricate relation with the number of parameters that were target of fine tuning in the evaluation and validation process.

%	The evolution procedure adopted concerning the controllers culminated in three characteristic behaviors. The controller evolved on road tracks became a fast driver, whose hastiness resulted in a careless attitude in general; in other words, it was only good for races in road tracks. The one evolved on dirt tracks turned out to be too careful in contrast, limitedly determining its speeds and, in efficiency terms, inferior. The controller evolved on a mixed set of tracks inherited characteristics from both the previous ones, becoming swift but not too hasty, prudent but not too slow. The latter surpassed the performance of the dirt-evolved drivers even on dirt tracks, and did not lose by far on road tracks in comparison to drivers evolved solely in them.

%	In terms of speed, the Three-State FSM was able to overcome AUTOPIA in one of the three tracks used to validate the drivers using the distance covered in 10 000 game tics as metric. However, in comparison to the same controller, using the time elapsed to race 10 laps as metric instead, the experimental results provided an insight on the lack of endurance that the finite state machine drivers proposed possess.

%	To sum up, the interpretation of the global results from the experiments performed gives margin to declare that finite state machines are a reliable technique to implement artificial intelligences, at least for computer games such as simulated races. They provide the possibility of parallel development and also enable parameter tuning in separate fronts, due to the independence and abstraction between the behaviors from each state. Finite state machines also represent a valuable tool for describing an operation model for a process, simplifying and gathering possible situations it might present into straightforward categories of accessible understanding.

% \subsection{Future Works} \label{subsec:Future}
A clear issue with the proposed models was the lack of endurance. To improve the general performance of the controllers in this matter, longer periods should be considered in the fitness function, and more robust techniques, such as harsher brake policies or path planning, could be integrated into the model. Focus must be set on developing skills for the racing stage of the championship, specially for dealing with opponents.

Additionally, a better breaking system, such as anti-lock breaking system~\cite{5593318} or traction control system~\cite{5593318}, could lead to improved performance by reducing skidding and providing more stable breaking and curve handling, enabling higher speeds in the race. GA search could also be improved through a better setting of the algorithm's parameters, a less general approach to representing a solution for the model, or even incorporating fuzzy logic~\cite{DIEGO} to handle ordering issues with some parameters could simply solve this ordering issue.
