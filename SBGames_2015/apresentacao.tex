\section{Introduction}%
\begin{frame}%
	self-driving cars should drive safely, efficiently, and legally.

	Goals:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item shorter response times
		\item better fuel consumption
		\item lower levels of pollution
		\item others
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}%

\begin{frame}%
	process of developing driving algorithms is also complicated and expensive.

	Advanced programs can closely simulate the roads, other vehicles, and their complex interactions and may be used for machine learning
