\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions}

	This paper proposed two approaches developed to control a car during a race in a simulated computational environment, the game platform TORCS. The models of both of these controllers were described, explained, enhanced by means of a genetic algorithm, compared and then tested together with a State of the Art controller - AUTOPIA. It was implied before the testing phase that a finite state machine too burdened in the process of transition between states might lose performance, which was corroborated by the experimental results of the comparison of the two models detailed.
		
\subsection{Conclusions} \label{subsec:Conclusions}

	The interpretation of the global results from the experiments performed gives margin to declare that finite state machines are a reliable technique to implement artificial intelligences, at least for computer games such as simulated races. They provide the possibility of parallel development and also enable parameter tuning in separate fronts, due to the independence and abstraction between the behaviors from each state.

	The finite state machine with less states achieved a superior overall performance in the tests carried out. The simplifications fashioned in its transition function were inferred to be the reason for this improvement, along with its intricate relation with the number of parameters that were target of fine tuning in the evaluation and validation process.
	
	The evolution procedure adopted concerning the controllers culminated in three characteristic behaviors. The controller evolved on road tracks became a fast driver, whose hastiness resulted in a careless attitude in general; in other words, it was only good for races in road tracks. The one evolved on dirt tracks turned out to be too careful in contrast, limitedly determining its speeds and, in efficiency terms, inferior. The controller evolved on a mixed set of tracks inherited characteristics from both the previous ones, becoming swift but not too hasty, prudent but not too slow. The latter surpassed the performance of the dirt-evolved drivers even on dirt tracks, and did not lose by far on road tracks in comparison to drivers evolved solely in them.

\subsection{Future Works} \label{subsec:Future}

	\toDo{Since at the SCRC the controller is allowed to perform a warm-up before the race, it is possible to acquire the track data, not only mapping critical section such as sharp curves and points where the car go out the track to improve the result of the controller at the race itself. Also a warp-up stage would supply the information about environment where the car is, including the type of track,road or dirt, which determine a set of parameters best fitted to which occasion. (JÃ¡ foi feito.)}
		
	One important task to be accomplished is the opponent treatment in real-time races. Routines to reduce collisions, i.e., avoiding being overtaken and also being concerned about overtaking the opponents is a fundamental issue. Ignoring adjacent cars usually causes the driver to face unexpected collisions, ending up stuck, considering a worst case scenario. Many of the renowned developers for TORCS already incorporate such treatment in their controllers, and neglecting this necessity renders any driver less robust to unexpected race events, and also reduces its performance.
